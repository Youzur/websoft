        <h1>A report from the course <br>Web Development</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S01</h2>
        <p>Yes, we have used in previous school projects.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have never created a website.</p>
        <p>
            My experience with web application development is that it is a constantly changing technology. Web techniques are
            always looking for ways to be more efficient for the developers, to which the developers can find different
            interactive web pages that could be helpful, or pleasing, depending on the target users.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this course section, we learned the uses of having a version control environment to which we can save our
            progress online. It also enables us access older versions of our work which is very useful in case something
            goes wrong.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S02</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, I have previous worked with HTML, CSS, and JS. I started learning these programs when I was in
            middle-school and then studied extensively on it in high-school.
        </p>
        <p> The roles of HTML, CSS, and JS are:
        <ul>HTML
            <li>
                It is the mesh/skeletal structure of the webpage, were we can place texts and/or arrange different
                containers for different topics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>CSS
            <li>
                It is the "skin" of the webpage. Here we design how our webpages can look, for example, adding a
                background color of red to the webpage, or increase the font size of our text.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>JS
            <li>
                It is the interactiveness of the webpage. Here we can add data to our webpage structure, for example,
                having a button that, when clicked, shall append data to a container in the webpage.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Basically, a browser communicates with a web server through HTTP protocol. The browser makes a request to a web
            server, to which the server responses back data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The TIL of this course is to learn how to develop Web based Applications, and how different software communicate
            with each other to create interactive and colorful web pages.
        </p>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S03</h2>
        <p>No, I do not have any previous knowledge on client side JavaScript</p>
        <p>A comparison to JS that I could think of is the Java Programming Language. Most of how the syntax that are used
            are very similar to how Java works. An example would be how the if-statements are used. Both almost use the same
            way the arguments are placed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The coding exercises are very helpful, although there were some unclear instructions as to the placements of the
            files in folders. The aim is to just get a grade 3 due to the stress of having a different course commencing at
            the same time as the web development course.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this course section was to program in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to use the fetch API in order to
            get data in JavaScript and place it onto the sandbox in HTML format.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S04</h2>
        <p>A similarity to node.js is when we tried out the communication between the server and the client. This was done in
            our Data Communications course in which we create Sockets in Java that helps establish a non-blocking connection
            from the server to the client and that made the flow asynchronous.</p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is what gives functionality to our web application. So it is essentially a very important tool to
            have when developing unique and complex websites. By adding Node.js, we establish a server-client relationships
            with websites. Having Express.js implemented into JavaScript and Node.js is very useful to create an easy-to-use
            framework which we can use to manipulate routes in the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            My plan was to first look through the documentations and examine the setup. Next, was to study the examples that
            were given, as they have been the most helpful tool for gaining information on how everything was connected to
            each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim was for grade 3 due to having a heavy course(Thesis work) at the same time as web development course.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment was to understand how to establish a client-server based website, and learn to
            manipulate routes for better code structure.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S05</h2>
        <p>At first glance, it was intimidating due to it being an old programming languages. After going through the
            exercise and studying the examples given, I realised that it was quite simpler than expected. It was like a
            combination of creating web structures(HTML) and functionalities using scripting made by PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not really. At first, it made me think of server management that could be done in Javafx, to create visual
            representation of data sent from the server to the client but more strict than PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exercises were very helpful for quickly learn the uses of PHP. To make things easier, PHP seemed to be a
            programming language that has a smooth learning curve. I aimed for a grade 3 due to shortage of time because of
            having a bigger course at the same time as this one. I'm not really satisfied, obviously. I would have liked to
            send more time to get a higher grade.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment was to learning how PHP can manipulate a MySQL database. By using the CRUD methods in
            PHP we can employ different requests to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data in the database. An example would
            be searching through the database by using the Read CRUD methods in PHP.
        </p>

        <h2>S06</h2>
        <p>
            My opinion on the popularity of different programming languages is that many depend on which
            situations/scenarios that it is being used. An example would be using React.js to create unique web applications
            that are suitable for making single-paged web applications. Another example is a rising popularity in using
            Kotlin for Android Development, due to it being statically viable than using Java, for example the unnecessary
            use of data type instead of just using "var".
        </p>
        <p>
            Using software stacks seems to be in rising popularity when assigning what programming languages a
            company, or branch, want to use. A software stack is a sort of bundle that is a collection of subsystems or
            platforms to which that are well-fitted together. An example would be the MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
            Node.js) stack. My choice would either be web-based programming languages and learn a software stack, either
            MERN or MEAN(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Comparison between two frameworks: Angular and React. Filtered only for topics in Computers and Electronics</strong>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC02/embed_loader.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/g/11c6w0ddw9","geo":"","time":"today 5-y"},{"keyword":"React","geo":"","time":"today 5-y"}],"category":5,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"cat=5&date=today%205-y&q=%2Fg%2F11c6w0ddw9,React","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>
            Here, we can see that, in the past 5 years, Angular and React has been in a competitive state between each
            other. It starts off, in 2014, by Angular having a higher rating than React, due to it being a new
            platform(not mistaken to AngularJS) with its newer implications in Front-end development. Gradually, React
            has risen in popularity for updating to simpler single-page web crafting methods which beginners can
            easily learn and adapt to.
        </p>
        <p>
            A framework I would highly recommend is React. React has made its point by expressing simplicity for
            creating single-pages applications. It makes it easy to make interactive UIs with simple views and
            straightforward state change interactions for the applications. Another great advantage of using React is
            its efficient way to render and update data. The coding aspects of React is, basically, doing HTML with JS
            embedded into the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment was to better understand how web-based frameworks are better tools to use, to
            have a understanding on which programming languages can be useful to projects of different sizes. We
            compared frameworks to see how much change has been done, and to see which frameworks shall continue on for
            me years on.
        </p>

        <h2>S07</h2>
        <p>
            Basically, .NET is a framework platform that equips the programmer with the ability to create different
            types of applications. It uses C# programming language to code applications. ASP.NET is for creating
            web-based applications using C# programming as the base.
        </p>
        <p>
            If one is experienced in Java, it can be quite easy to get a hang of C# due to its coding being very similar
            to each other. Another technology that we have learned in this course that is closest to being similar to
            .NET would be PHP. The reason is because of how one can create web applications with PHP programming and
            ASP.NET programming. I would compare it more to Java due to how the code structure are very similar. An
            example would be when creating class to create objects of, creating private methods, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grade aim of this exercise is 3. The exercise was quite unique to because the console aspect of it was
            very similar to what we have previously done. Meanwhile the ASP.NET aspect was challenging as we have never
            attempted to make a web-based "Java" programming. The closest to ASP.NET could be JavaFX, when creating a
            UI to an application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment was to learn the .NET and ASP.NET programming languages. We practiced it by
            making a menu to which the users can interact, and taking a JSON data and printing the contents when the
            user chooses the option to. Similar objective when programming in ASP.NET, we instead have a page that
            prints the JSON data onto a HTML table to display it for the user.

        <strong>Groupwork</strong>
        <p>Our group has chosen three websites to test out their performances: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>thebestwebsiteintheinternet.com</li>
            <li>https://stackoverflow.com/</li>

            </iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment was to test the performance of the websites that we found. By using testing
            websites, such as Lighthouse, we were able to analyze the audits of the websites. We were displayed with an
            overall analysis of each audit that helped us indicate what issues that would cause a website to slow down,
            for example.
        </p>

    <section class="section-box">
        <h2>S09</h2>
        <p>
            One security issue that comes to mind is the Injections. If one does not have a secure web page, a
            hacker can easily enter malicious SQL sequences to gather information about customers or users accessing
            the website.

            Another security issue is IDOR. It is when a hacker can gain access to information by manipulating the URL
            sequencing when redirecting to a page. With this, one can download as many sensitive information of the
            users of that website. The cause of this is poor security URL management.

            XSS Cross-Site Scripting is a very unique was of manipulating a website with poorly coded sanitisation
            method. XSS is when a hacker enters his/her own JS script as an input, for example, in a input field of
            such poorly maintained website, and be able to create havoc, or steal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            A good way to have a secure website when creating one is having a recommended password manager, for example
            when creating a Login functionality into the website. Another good practice is to have backups, in case an
            incident were to happen. This insures credibility for both the customers and the creators of the website.
            All the security issues that have been mentioned are important threats which should be looked into
            avoiding/patch from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
            The TIL of this assignment is Web Security. Over the years, hackers have attacked many websites and gathered
            important data from customers. It is vital, as developers, to study and understand how a hacker thinks and
            learn to counter these malicious attacks.
