<h1>A report from the course <br>Web Development</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
    <p>Yes, we have used in previous school projects.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I have never created a website.</p>
    <p>
        My experience with web application development is that it is a constantly changing technology. Web techniques are
        always looking for ways to be more efficient for the developers, to which the developers can find different
        interactive web pages that could be helpful, or pleasing, depending on the target users.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course section, we learned the uses of having a version control environment to which we can save our
        progress online. It also enables us access older versions of our work which is very useful in case something
        goes wrong.
    </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, I have previous worked with HTML, CSS, and JS. I started learning these programs when I was in
        middle-school and then studied extensively on it in high-school.
    </p>
    <p> The roles of HTML, CSS, and JS are:
        <ul>HTML
            <li>
                It is the mesh/skeletal structure of the webpage, were we can place texts and/or arrange different
                containers for different topics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>CSS
            <li>
                It is the "skin" of the webpage. Here we design how our webpages can look, for example, adding a
                background color of red to the webpage, or increase the font size of our text.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>JS
            <li>
                It is the interactiveness of the webpage. Here we can add data to our webpage structure, for example,
                having a button that, when clicked, shall append data to a container in the webpage.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Basically, a browser communicates with a web server through HTTP protocol. The browser makes a request to a web
        server, to which the server responses back data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The TIL of this course is to learn how to develop Web based Applications, and how different software communicate
        with each other to create interactive and colorful web pages.
    </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
    <p>No, I do not have any previous knowledge on client side JavaScript</p>
    <p>A comparison to JS that I could think of is the Java Programming Language. Most of how the syntax that are used
        are very similar to how Java works. An example would be how the if-statements are used. Both almost use the same
         way the arguments are placed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The coding exercises are very helpful, although there were some unclear instructions as to the placements of the
         files in folders. The aim is to just get a grade 3 due to the stress of having a different course commencing at
         the same time as the web development course.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TIL of this course section was to program in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to use the fetch API in order to
        get data in JavaScript and place it onto the sandbox in HTML format.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
    <p>A similarity to node.js is when we tried out the communication between the server and the client. This was done in
        our Data Communications course in which we create Sockets in Java that helps establish a non-blocking connection
        from the server to the client and that made the flow asynchronous.</p>
    <p>
        JavaScript is what gives functionality to our web application. So it is essentially a very important tool to
        have when developing unique and complex websites. By adding Node.js, we establish a server-client relationships
        with websites. Having Express.js implemented into JavaScript and Node.js is very useful to create an easy-to-use
        framework which we can use to manipulate routes in the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        My plan was to first look through the documentations and examine the setup. Next, was to study the examples that
        were given, as they have been the most helpful tool for gaining information on how everything was connected to
        each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The aim was for grade 3 due to having a heavy course(Thesis work) at the same time as web development course.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TIL of this assignment was to understand how to establish a client-server based website, and learn to
        manipulate routes for better code structure.
